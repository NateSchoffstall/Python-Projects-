# Python-Projects-
These are some of my personal projects I have worked on, primarily using Python
The first is Called the Curse of the Crypt: It is a text based adventure game, with NPC's dialogue trees and puzzles

The Second two files are apart of the same project, It is a UDP Audio message application
It is in the client/server format, where two seperate users can communicate in real time with speech
